this is a animation extracter for dst* or ds**      * short for don't starve together  ** short for don't starve


Tutorial---

Source code needed the first three things needed

1. anim.bin               for animation you want
2. build.bin              for the build of character you want
3. atlas.tex              for the texture of char you want

put all this in the source-code folder

how to find that three things?
= first you need to buy the don't starve game series and go to the don't starve game folder where you download the game. if download in steam
example: D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Don't Starve Together or D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Don't Starve
and go to anim folder in the data folder and search you char name example: search name Wilson and find wilson.zip, not wilsonfx.zip
and go inside the zip file and get file build.bin and atlas.tex now search for animation you want.
example: player idles and finds player_idles.zip go inside the zip file and get file anim.bin !!!ONLY ANIM.BIN!!!

overwrite ??? to output name and run command in cmd.


D:\Mono\Downloads\Coding\DST\ktools-4.4.4\krane.exe D:\Mono\Downloads\Coding\DST\Souce-code\anim.bin D:\Mono\Downloads\Coding\DST\Souce-code\build.bin "D:\Mono\Downloads\Coding\DST\Output\???"

Done!!! now the output is in the output folder named what you name them
as spriter project and run (output name).scml to see animation

what is a spriter?
= spriter is a program animation made by brashmonkey. klei use to make this game.
if you don't have one download it https://brashmonkey.com/download-spriter-pro/
select the icon and download. example: you on window click window icon to download.
and now you can run the scml file!!!
